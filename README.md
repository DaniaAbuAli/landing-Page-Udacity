# Landing Page Project

## Project Description

In this project, we create a landing page with navigation using JavaScript. When we click an item from the menu, it will smoothly scroll to its corresponding section, and the clicked item will be highlighted. Additionally, at the bottom of the page, there is a button that, when clicked, will take you back to the top of the page.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
